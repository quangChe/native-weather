# React Native Weather App

A basic mobile app that simply displays the current weather of a searched location using real weather data. 

The app is compatible with both Android and iOS. It is built using React Native with Expo. 


## Getting Started

### 1. Download Expo
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Expo is a library of tools and services built around React Native to build native iOS and Android apps in JavaScript. More details can be found in their [documentation](https://docs.expo.io/).

### 2. Boot Up Expo Dev Tools
```
cd native-weather
npm install
npm start
```

To view the development build of the app, first install all necessary packages and start up the Expo Development Tools. Expo will open in the browser where it will host the app through various methods to be viewed on iOS Simulator, an Android Virtual Device, or from the Expo mobile app.
