# React Native Weather App

A basic mobile app that simply displays the current weather of a searched location using real weather data. 

The app is compatible with both Android and iOS. It is built using React Native with Expo tools. 


## Getting Started

### 1. Download Expo
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Expo is a library of tools and services built around React Native to build native iOS and Android apps in JavaScript. More details can be found in their [documentation](https://docs.expo.io/).

### 2. Boot Up Expo Dev Tools
```
npm install
npm start
```

Expo will build the project and open a DevTools interface inside your browser. The project app can then be inspected locally on iOS Simulator or Android Virtual Device. Atlernatively, Expo provides sets up a tunnel for viewing the app through a mobile device via the Expo app, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play.
